## Project Overview

Bank ACMEâ€™s Office of Compliance is a department responsible for monitoring the activities and conduct of employees: whenever an irregularity is detected, the bank must analyze whether the irregularity stems from misconduct or weaknesses in the process, in order to mitigate the operational risk and apply the penalty to those involved, if applicable, including possible compensation for financial losses. 

The procedure starts with a process called preliminary analysis that consists in an investigation and aims to gather information about the issue, like authorship, which rule was broken, description of the facts, value involved, etc. After all the relevant information is gathered, the final report and the chain of evidence are sent to decision-making authority for deliberation. If the case is admitted, the indictee becomes defendant and is subject to penalties like written reprimand, suspension and discharge. 

This project addresses the real world problem of identifying whether the case will be admitted or not, based in some multiple-choice fields filled in the report.
